# VIT_TINDER ðŸ’˜

Welcome to **VIT_TINDER** â€“ a custom-designed Tinder-style UI made just for fun, inspired by swipe-based dating apps, and tailored in **my own style**!

This is a **frontend-only project** created using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, with no real matching or data handling â€“ just a visual and interactive demo.

## âš¡ Whatâ€™s This Really?

This project is a **Tinder UI clone** reimagined in my own way â€“ built to showcase creativity and frontend skills.  
Itâ€™s **not a functioning dating app** and doesnâ€™t collect or store any data.

## ðŸš€ Future Scope (If You Want to Build on It)

While I'm not actively working on this anymore, here are some ideas if you'd like to take it further:

- Add a **backend** (e.g., Firebase, Express, or Supabase)  
- Build a **matching algorithm** and **user profiles**  
- Enable **real-time chat** with sockets  
- Add login/signup and authentication
